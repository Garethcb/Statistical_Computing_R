# Statistical Computing Using R Programming Language

This repository illustrates my proficiency in R and its related libraries through the creation of an Executive report. Not only is my coding on display but so too is my ability to solve problems and succinctly provide insights into the problems at hand.

This report demonstrates my ability to perform data cleaning, EDA, pre-process data, fit models, and evaluate models using R (tidy-Models).  Most notably, I illustrate the use of PCA to discover hidden patterns within the dataset, cross-validation to avoid overfitting, contrast the performance of prediction models to assess their viability, and communicate results of the interpretation and analysis of predictive modelling.
